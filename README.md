## Description

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. Following the MVC design pattern, this application uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML that renders in the browser.

### How it works

The following steps explain how this "Eat-Da-Burger" application works:

1. A user submits a burger's name that they'd like to eat.

2. The app displays the burger in the waiting area - located on the left side of the page, waiting for it to be devoured, with a `Devour it!` button.

3. When a user clicks the `Devour it!` button, the selected burger will move to the right side of the page.

Note: The app stores every burger in the MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
