# burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.  Following the MVC design pattern; this application uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
